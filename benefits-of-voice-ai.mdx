### Implementation Strategies

#### Start Small, Scale Smart

```md
Phase 1: Simple FAQs (Week 1-2)
Goal: Handle 20% of common questions
Metrics: Resolution rate, customer satisfaction

Phase 2: Transactional Tasks (Week 3-4)
Goal: Enable order tracking, appointments
Metrics: Completion rate, error handling

Phase 3: Complex Workflows (Week 5-8)
Goal: Multi-step processes with context
Metrics: Success rate, conversation quality
```

#### Choose the Right Use Cases

High-value scenarios for Voice AI:

- Frequently asked questions with well-defined answers
- Repetitive tasks that consume agent time
- After-hours support for time-sensitive issues
- Order status and tracking inquiries
- Appointment scheduling and modifications
- Lead qualification and routing

Avoid starting with:

- Highly emotional or sensitive conversations
- Unstructured exploratory queries
- Tasks requiring deep domain expertise without training
- Processes with low volume or complexity
- Scenarios with frequently changing requirements

#### Quality Guardrails

```json
{
  "voice_quality_metrics": {
    "accuracy": "Word error rate < 5% for transcription",
    "response_time": "< 2 seconds for intent recognition",
    "naturalness": "Mean Opinion Score > 4.0",
    "completion_rate": "Successful task completion > 85%",
    "escalation_rate": "Human handoff < 15%"
  },
  "business_metrics": {
    "cost_per_interaction": "60% reduction vs human agent",
    "customer_satisfaction": "CSAT score > 4.0",
    "resolution_rate": "First-contact resolution > 70%",
    "adoption_rate": "Repeat usage > 40%"
  }
}
```

### Industry Applications

#### Healthcare

- Appointment scheduling and reminders
- Insurance verification and claims status
- Medication adherence and follow-ups
- Symptom triage before doctor visits
- Post-discharge patient monitoring

```md
Example: Patient calls to check prescription refill status
Voice AI: "Hello! I can help with that. What's your prescription number?"
Patient: [provides number]
Voice AI: "Your refill is ready for pickup. Would you like me to send a reminder text?"
Patient: "Yes, please"

Result: 2-minute interaction, zero hold time, no agent needed
```
